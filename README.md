# Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
This is a brief guide to business exploration through hypothesis testing and statistical analysis. The full length code is available in the accompanying notebook and a slide deck demonstrating the practicality of hypothesis testing is also included.

# Summary
We demonstrate the practicality and necessity of implementing statistical analysis for businesses by developing insights from the Northwind Traders database. Our goal is to determine whether discount amount of specialty foods has a statstically significant effect on the amount of product ordered, and if so, at what discount levels do we observe significance. We achieve this by querying the database with SQL, designing an experiment, and then performing Welch's t-test plus a one-way ANOVA. In addition, we extract several more data-driven insights from the database to help guide the company.
